# Object-Detection

This repository is a tutorial for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Windows 10, 8, or 7. (It will also work on Linux-based OSes with some minor changes.) It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.5, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow.
